This project involves the development of a control system based on Arduino to manage the
brightness of a disturbance light (a warning light) and a status indicator. The system allows users to
adjust the brightness of the disturbance light, providing visual feedback for different control
scenarios. Additionally, the project will be interfaced with Processing software to display the status of
the light and control parameters in real time.
